        My name is Frank Olmsted and I am an aspiring web developer! I graduated
        from the UCONN Coding Bootcamp in July of 2023 and am actively looking
        for web development work. I currently work fulltime at Digitech
        Computer, an EMS billing software company. I love making new connections
        and learning as much as I can from whoever is willing to pass knowledge
        along. Feel free to contact me through my email, LinkedIn, or Github!
